    "paragraph1": "The program draws its inspiration from the message of ISKCON’s Founder-Acharya Srila Prabhupada who envisioned that no one within a 10-mile radius of its center should go hungry. With that mission in mind, our team of professional and selfless volunteers have served over 550 crore plates of meals till date.During the Covid pandemic, ISKCON’s food distribution (or also known as Annadan seva) has benefited millions of people across the world. At the request of several state governments, ISKCON food relief helped migrant workers, police officers, and front-line staff by providing nutritious and fresh meals as per their taste. Since the beginning of Covid pandemic, our team has distributed over 76 crore plates of meals. ISKCON and its affiliate foundations would like to thank the governments, donors, volunteers, and well-wishers for helping us play our part in combating COVID-19."
